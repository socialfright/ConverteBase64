# ConverteBase64

This project was made after I saw many videos of Crypters, using
a Base64 converter and decided to make my own copy of it.
All it does is convert a File to base64.


* Copies to clipboard

Just Click on "Archivo" choose the file you would like to convert 
then click "Convertir" and lastly "Copiar" to copy to clipboard
Make sure to star if you would like :)
